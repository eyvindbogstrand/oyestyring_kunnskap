This consists of classic locked-in syndrome, characterized by the inability to move distal limbs and facial muscles, but retained ability to blink and move eyes vertically, with preserved cognition and consciousness. Incomplete locked-in syndrome is less severe as classic locked-in syndrome and shares similar preserved abilities as classic locked-in syndrome, but has the hallmark of additional motor abilities, whether that be in the muscles innervating the limbs or face. Complete locked-in syndrome contains the conserved cognition and consciousness as classic locked-in syndrome, but has additional motor deficits that render the individual unable to move their eyes vertically or blink. Locked-in plus is an additional form distinguished by impairments to cognition and consciousness, but contains damage to similar regions of the brainstem affected by other forms, notably the pons, with the addition of other cortical and subcortical regions.",

Those with locked-in syndrome may be able to communicate with others through coded messages by blinking or moving their eyes, which are often not affected by the paralysis. Patients who have locked-in syndrome are conscious and aware, with no loss of cognitive function. They can sometimes retain proprioception and sensation throughout their bodies. Some patients may have the ability to move certain facial muscles, and most often some or all of the extraocular muscles. Individuals with the syndrome lack coordination between breathing and voice. This prevents them from producing voluntary sounds, though the vocal cords themselves may not be paralysed.",

Locked-in syndrome patients also have been reported to have involuntary movements such as sucking, chewing, swallowing, yawning, and moaning due to lost pyramidal control of motor systems.\n\nCauses\n\nUnlike persistent vegetative state, in which the upper portions of the brain are damaged and the lower portions are spared, locked-in syndrome is essentially the opposite, caused by damage to specific portions of the lower brain and brainstem, with no damage to the upper brain. Injuries to the pons are the most common cause of locked-in syndrome.\n\nPossible causes of locked-in syndrome include:",

In a 2002 survey of 44 people with locked-in syndrome, it took almost three months to recognize and diagnose the condition after it had begun.

Locked-in syndrome may mimic loss of consciousness in patients, or, in the case that respiratory control is lost, may even resemble death.
