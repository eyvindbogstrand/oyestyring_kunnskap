The term accessibility is most often used in reference to specialized hardware or software, or a combination of both, designed to enable the use of a computer by a person with a disability or impairment.\n\nAccessibility is often abbreviated as the numeronym a11y, where the number 11 refers to the number of letters omitted.  This parallels the abbreviations of internationalization and localization as i18n and l10n, respectively.  Moreover, a11y is also listed on the USPTO Supplemental Register under Accessibility Now, Inc.\n\nAccessibility features",

Some of these impairments, which can be acquired from disease, trauma, or congenital disorders, include:\n\nCognitive impairments (head injury, autism, developmental disabilities) and learning disabilities, (such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, or ADHD).\n\nVisual impairment, such as low-vision, complete or partial blindness, and color blindness.\n\nHearing-related disabilities (deafness), including deafness, being hard of hearing, and hyperacusis.\n\nMotor or dexterity impairment such as paralysis, cerebral palsy, dyspraxia, carpal tunnel syndrome, and repetitive strain injury.",

Similar to computer accessibility, web accessibility is the practice of making the use of the World Wide Web easier to use for individuals with disabilities.\n\nAccessibility options for specific impairments\n\nCognitive impairments and illiteracy\n\nThe biggest challenge in computer accessibility is to make resources accessible to people with cognitive disabilities—particularly those with poor communication and reading skills. For example, people with learning disabilities may rely on proprietary symbols and identify particular products via the product's symbols or icons.  Unfortunately, copyright laws can limit icon or symbol release to web-based programs and websites by owners who are unwilling to release them to the public.",

Keyboard shortcuts and mouse gestures are ways to achieve this access, as are more specialized solutions, including on-screen software keyboards and alternate input devices (switches, joysticks and trackballs).

Accessible technology can enable personalized learning for all students.\n\n\nImpacts in the classroom\nWhen accessible technology allows personalized learning, there are positive impacts on students. Personalized learning switches the focus from what is being taught to what is being learned. This allows the students to need to become an integral part of the learning process. Accessibility in the classroom allows millions of students of all backgrounds to have equal educational opportunities and keep up with their non-disabled peers.\nWhen PCs are personalized for students in the classroom, students are more comfortable in the classroom, special needs students are better assisted and teachers can save time and effort.\nWhile PCs can provide a large amount of support in the classroom, iPads and apps can play a large role as well. Apps are constantly being developed to aid teachers, parents, and children. Educators have noted that the ease and portability of tablets make them a preferred choice that offers usage in a variety of environments. The advantages include interactivity, Internet access and text messaging. Educators have noticed improvements in motor skills, reading skills, and interaction with others in students.\n\n\nImpacts outside the classroom\nParents and teachers can notice the long-term effects that accessibility has on students with disabilities. This can include enhanced social skills, better relationships with family and friends, increased understanding of the world around them, and an exhibition of self-reliance and confidence. Changes can be seen in not only children but adults as well. Social media can help parents to learn, share knowledge, and receive moral support.\n\n\nEffects in the workplace\nComputer accessibility plays a large role in the workplace. In the past few years, adults have had their disabilities accommodated by the ability to work from home and by the availability of reliable software. This allows workers to work in a comfortable area while still being able to support themselves. This is allowing thousands of people with disabilities to create and earn jobs for themselves. The inexpensiveness and reliability of computers has facilitated the process.\n\n\nSpecial needs assessments\nPeople wishing to overcome an impairment in order to use a computer comfortably may require a \"special needs assessment\" by an assistive technology consultant (such as an occupational therapist, a rehabilitation engineering technologist, or an educational technologist) to help them identify and configure appropriate assistive technologies to meet individual needs.  Even those who are unable to leave their own home or who live far from assessment providers may be assessed (and assisted) remotely using remote desktop software and a web cam. For example, the assessor logs on to the client's computer via a broadband Internet connection, observes the user's computer skills, and then remotely makes accessibility adjustments to the client's computer where necessary.\n\n\nStandards and regulations regarding computer accessibility\n\n\nSection 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973\nSection 508 requires US Federal agencies make their electronic and information technology (EIT) accessible to all disabled employees and members of the public. The US Access Board develops and maintains the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) accessibility standards. The Access Board issued a final rule that went into effect on January 18, 2018, updating accessibility requirements under Section 508. This final rule requires that all electronic content generated by US Federal agencies must conform to Level A and Level AA success criteria in WCAG 2.0, with four exceptions for non-Web documents: 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks, 2.4.5 Multiple Ways, 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation, and 3.2.4 Consistent Identification.\n\n\nInternational Standards\nISO 9241-171:2008\nISO 9241-171:2008 is a standard that provides ergonomics guidance and specifications for the design of accessible software for public use.\nCompiled from independent standards experts, this document is the most comprehensive and technical standard for designing accessible features for software,  covering all disabilities and all aspects of software. It provides examples of two priority levels ('Required' and 'Recommended') and offers a handy checklist designed to help with recording software testing results.\nBecause of its complexity and technical nature, and with upwards of 150 individual statements, ISO 9241-172 is difficult to interpret and apply. Luckily, not every statement is relevant to every situation, so it may be advisable to identify a subset of statements that are tailored to the particular software environment, making the use of this document much more achievable.\n\n\nSee also\nAssistive technology\nAugmentative and alternative communication\nDigital rights\nGame accessibility\nGlobal Accessibility Awareness Day\nKnowbility\nModding\nUbiquitous computing\nWeb accessibility\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nThe annual ERCIM Workshop on 'User Interfaces for All' emphasizing accessibility\nBetter Living Through Technology - contains guides on accessibility options and information about specialist assistive hardware and software\nHP Accessibility\nAbilityNet - provides information on accessibility, assistive technology, and remote assessment\nC4EA Consortium For E-learning Accessibility\nW3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)\nAccessibility in the Opera web browser\nMozilla Accessibility Project\nOpen Office Accessibility Project\nEU Project Guide: Multimodal user interfaces for elderly people with mild impairments"
